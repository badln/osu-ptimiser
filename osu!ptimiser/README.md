Please report any bugs to my GitHub repository!

This repository will (hopefully) improve the feedback of your osu!tablet and make it more responsive! 
It does this by scanning your computer for key information such as your osu!version, Tablet model, specific drivers and so forth. 
A huge underlying issue with most modern tablet drivers (and osu!) is that they do not use the proper windows utilisation features windows has in place. 
This simply shuffles around the drivers a bit and fixes that completely. 
You can expect to see between 5ms - 60ms of improvement just from running this EXE.
Warning: this does alter the registry, but that is only so it can change the drivers assigned to your tablet!
